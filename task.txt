🌐 Front-End (Basic)
A minimal front-end (can be hosted on GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify) that:
● Connects wallet via Phantom (or any Solana-compatible wallet)
● Shows the current balance of the Tip Jar
● Has a button to Tip 0.01 SOL
● If logged-in wallet is the owner, show a button to Withdraw funds
You may use:
● HTML + JavaScript (or)
● React + Solana Wallet Adapter (minimal setup)
🚀 Deliverables
Submit the following:
1. GitHub Repo link with:
○ Rust smart contract (with Anchor)
○ Front-end code
2. Live Deployed URL of front-end (on GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. A README that includes:
○ Program ID (deployed address)
○ How to test locally or on Devnet
○ Any known issues or limitations
🔧 Tech Stack Expectations
● Solana Toolchain (Anchor CLI, Solana CLI)
● Rust (Solana programs)
● Basic familiarity with wallet adapters & web3.js
● Optional brownie points: use of environment variables, clean UI, responsiveness
🧠 What We'll Evaluate
● Code quality & modularity
● Understanding of Solana PDA concepts & lamport transfers
● Ability to secure funds (ownership checks, devnet deployment)
● Ability to wire up a working front-end
● Developer experience: is it easy to follow and run?
